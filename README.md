# genai-tutorials

### This repo hosts code, tutorials and resources for the generative AI learning path

It is broken down into weekly workshops and supplemental resources.

The goal of this learning path is for someone who is familiar with full stack development to become a proficient generative AI developer.

By the end of the learning path, you will go from being able to use generative ai as a customer, to being able to build a complex, production ready generative AI applications, leveraging techniques such as RAG and fine-tuning.

If you have any comments or suggestions you can reach out to me.
